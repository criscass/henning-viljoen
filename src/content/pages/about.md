## My Personal Information

Educated at the University of Pretoria where I obtained the degrees BA (Law) (1965) and LLB (1967). I completed my articles with the firm of Dyason Douglas Muller & Meyer and was admitted as Attorney, Notary and Conveyancer in 1969. After a few years in practice, I went to Holland where I obtained the degree Doctor of Laws at the University of Leiden in 1975. After returning to South Africa, I joined the staff of the University of Pretoria in 1976 as senior lecturer and was promoted to professor in Public Law in 1983. I took early retirement in 1998 and resumed full time practice as attorney in Pretoria, specializing in Labour Law, after obtaining the Certificate in Advanced Labour Law from the University of Pretoria. In 2011 I moved to Hermanus, Western Cape, where I opened a practice as Attorney, Notary and Conveyancer.

From 2000 to 2021 I was a Commissioner of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa, the last four years as chairman.Â  I was also appointed as a Commissioner in the Small Claims Court in 1989 in Pretoria and continue serving as Commissioner since moving to Hermanus. In 2015 I obtained accreditation as mediator from the University of Cape Town.
